			<img alt="TheSarafa" src="Sarafa.jpg" width="400px" style="margin-right:15px" align="left"> Sarafa Bazaar (English: Sarafa Market) is a jewellery market and night street food court[1] located in central Indore, India. Sarafa is the only market in India which remains as a jewellery marketplace at daytime and converts itself into a street food court at night.[2] The market consists of two sub-markets namely Bada Sarafa Bazaar and Chhota Sarafa Bazaar. Indore's Sarafa Bazaar is a popular tourist place because of its cuisine and night lifestyle.[3]
			<br> The market originated as the central jewellery market in the city of Indore. Located 2 Kilometres from Indore's central marketplace Rajwada, Sarafa was the central trading point for jewellery, artefacts and ornaments. Due to its location and a large number of commuters and tourists, street food vendors started putting stalls and selling fast-food, snacks and chaat.[4] Eventually, street food vendors were allowed to put stalls after 8 PM (after jewellery market closes) until morning.[5] Sarafa is also the place of origin of Bada Sarafa Cotton Association, Indore and Madhya Pradesh Sarafa Association.
